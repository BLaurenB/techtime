This is a hand-rolled web application created by students at Turing School of Software and Design. The implementation was based on user stories for Categories, Items, and Users.

## Interacting with the live version of TechTime.
All users are able to view Categories, Freelancers, and add Freelancer Hours to a cart. Unauthenticated users can create an account.

Authenticated users are able to place an order for Freelancer Hours, as well as view their own orders.
Users have been seeded to the database. You can login to see other users' data by using the username and passwords in the seed files. Here's one set of credentials to try.
username:Janet456, password: password

Authenticated admins are able to create and edit Freelancer profiles, view and edit past Orders. Admins do not have the ability to create categories or to create additional admins. There is one Admin account.  
username: admin, password: password

For more about functionality, please see the testing suite.

## Implementing TechTime
TechTime is a Ruby on Rails application using Rails 5.
